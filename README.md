# Grades Calculator

## Project Description

When I was in high school, teachers would keep handing quizzes, assignments and tests back but would never tell us our 
overall grade until nearing the end of the term. To change this, I created this grade calculator that can easily keep 
track of your grades and update your average as the term and year progresses. Most classes weigh assignments more than 
quizzes, tests more than assignments, etc. This application is able to calculate your overall average by including the 
weighing of certain grade components. Overall, you will no longer have to scribble down old grades, try to calculate 
the weights of some assignments over others, and find a complicated average; this application does it all automatically 
for you.

## User Stories
These are some examples how the application can be used.
